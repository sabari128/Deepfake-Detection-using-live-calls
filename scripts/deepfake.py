### How to Run This (Simplified Demo):

1.  **Save:** Save the code as `deepfake.py`.
2.  **Install:** `pip install streamlit opencv-python numpy`
3.  **Run:** `streamlit run deepfake.py`

**Important Note:** This demo simulates the UI and detection logic on a *single machine*. For actual live video calls between two different people, you would need to integrate a WebRTC signaling server and client-side JavaScript to handle the peer-to-peer video stream.

st.markdown("""
### Next Steps for a Full Implementation:

* **Real-time WebRTC:** Research and implement a WebRTC solution (e.g., using a signaling server, `mediasoup`, `PeerJS` or `simple-peer` on the frontend, and a Python backend for WebRTC signaling).
* **Deepfake Detection Models:** This is the most challenging part.
    * **Data Collection:** Gather large datasets of real and deepfake videos.
    * **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features (e.g., facial landmarks, texture analysis, temporal inconsistencies).
    * **Model Training:** Train deep learning models (CNNs, LSTMs, Transformers) to classify real vs. fake. Look into existing research papers and open-source deepfake detection projects (e.g., FaceForensics++, DFDC dataset).
    * **Specific Detection Modules:**
        * **Head Pose:** Use `dlib` for facial landmarks and OpenCV's `solvePnP` for pose estimation.
        * **Lip-sync:** Develop models to analyze audio features against lip movements (e.g., using `OpenFace` or custom landmark extraction).
        * **Eye Blinking:** Calculate Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) from landmarks.
        * **Malicious Activities:** This requires sophisticated models looking for subtle artifacts or inconsistencies in generated faces.
* **Performance Optimization:** Real-time detection requires efficient models and optimized processing.
* **Error Handling and Robustness:** Handle network issues, camera errors, and various lighting conditions.
* **User Authentication/Rooms:** Implement a system for creating and joining specific call rooms.
